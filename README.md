Unless this looks and behaves like a finished app...it's probably not.

1. App
2. UI -> Home/Record/Book/Weather
3. Presentation layers
4. Domain layers
5. Repository layers
6. Data source layers

To Do...

Weather - api calls

Navigation - nav controller - one or more?

Configuration - inject into App and VM

Happy with VM loading/displaying/erroring?

State does NOT like nested objects - what works best?
